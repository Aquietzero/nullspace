# Operation

An operation $*$ on $A$ is a rule which assigns to each ordered pair $(a, b)$ of elements of $A$ exactly one element $a * b$ in $A$.

# Group

By a **group** we mean a set $G$ with an operation $*$ which satisfies the axioms:

1. $*$ is associative.
2. There is an element $e$ in $G$ such that $a * e = a$ and $e * a = a$ for every element $a$ in $G$.
3. For every element $a$ in $G$, there is an element $a^{-1}$ in $G$ such that $a * a^{-1} = e$ and $a^{-1} * a = e$.

<aside>
üí° Note that even though a group is not necessariy communicative, for axiom 2 and 3, identity and inverse of any element in $G$ has to be communicative.

</aside>

## Different Groups

### Abelian Group

If the communicative law holds in a group $G$, then the group is called a *communicative group*, or an **abelian group**.

### Semigroup

A set $A$ with an associative operation. (There does not need to be an identity element, nor do elements necessarily have inverses.)

### Symmetric Group

For any set $A$, the group of all the permutations of $A$ is called the *symmetric group on $A$*, and it is represented by the symbol $S_A$.

<aside>
üí° For any positive integer $n$, the symmetric group on the set $\{ 1, 2, 3, ..., n\}$ is called the symmetric group on n elements, and is denoted by $S_n$.

## Basic Properties of Groups

### Theorem 1

If $G$ is a group and $a, b, c$ are elements of $G$, then

1.  $ab = ac$ implies $b =c$
2. $ba = ca$ implies $b = c$

Left cancellation and right cancellation.

### Theorem 2

If $G$ is a group and $a, b$ are elements of $G$, then

$ab = e$ implies $a = b^{-1}$ and $b = a^{-1}$

Mutual inverse if the product equals identity.

### Theorem 3

If $G$ is a group and $a, b$ are elements of $G$, then

1. $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$
2. $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$

## Subgroup

Let $G$ be a group and $S$ is a nonempty subset of $G$. If

1. $S$ is closed with respect to multiplication,
2. $S$ is closed with respect to inverses,

then $S$ is a subgroup of $G$.

<aside>
üí° $S$ is called a subgroup because it is a group. The set containing only the identity, namely $\{ e \}$, is the smallest subgroup of $G$. $G$ itself is the largest subgroup of itself.

</aside>

## Normal Subgroup

Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$. $H$ is called a normal subgroup (Ê≠£ËßÑÂ≠êÁæ§) of $G$ if it is closed with respect to conjugates, that is, if

$$
\forall \ a \in H, x \in G, \  xax^{-1} \in H
$$

<aside>
üí° Note that according to this definition, a normal subgroup of $G$ is any nonempty subset of $G$ which is closed with respect to products, with repect to inverses, and with respect to conjugates.

</aside>

### Theorem 1

If $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then $aH = Ha$ for every $a \in G$.

### Theorem 2

Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. If $Ha = Hc$ and $Hb = Hd$, then $H(ab) = H(cd)$.

## Center of Group

The center of a group $G$ is the normal subgroup $C$ of $G$ consisting of all those elements of $G$ which commute with every element of $G$.

## Order of Group Elements

If there exists a nonzero integer $m$ such that $a^m = e$, then the order of the element $a$ is defined to be the least positive integer $n$ such that $a^n = e$. If there does not exist any nonzeror integer $m$ such that $a^m = e$, we say that $a$ has ordrer infinity.

# Quotient Groups

Let $G$ be a group and let $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. The set consists of all the cosets of $H$ is denoted by the symbol $G/H$.

$$
G/H = \{Hx : \forall \ x \in G \}
$$

$G/H$ with coset multiplication is a group. The group $G/H$ is called the **quotient group** (or factor group) of $G$ by $H$.

<aside>
üí° $G/H$ is a homomorphic image of $G$. The homomorphic function is $f(x) = Hx$ and $**f$ is called the natural homomorphism from $G$ onto $G/H$**.

</aside>

# Cosets

## Left and Right Coset

Let $G$ be a group, and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. For any element $a$ in $G$, the symbol $aH$ denotes the set of all products $ah$, as $a$ remains fixed and $h$ ranges over $H$. $aH$ is called a **left coset** of $H$ in $G$. Similarly, $Ha$ is called a **right coset** of $H$ in $G$.

## Theorem 1

The family of all the cosets $Ha$, as $a$ ranges over $G$, is a partition of $G$.

## Theorem 2

If $Ha$ is any coset of $H$, there is a one-to-one correspondence from $H$ to $Ha$.

## Theorem 3 [Lagrange's Theorem]

Let $G$ be a **finite group**, and $H$ be any subgroup of $G$. The order of $G$ is a multiple of the order of $H$.

## Theorem 4

If $G$ is a group with a prime number $p$ of elements, then $G$ is a cyclic group. Furthermore, any element $a \neq e$ in $G$ is a generator of $G$.

<aside>
üí° What is says is that there is (up to isomorphism) only one group of any given prime order $p$. For example, the only group (up to isomorphism) of order $7$  is $\mathbb{Z}_7$, the only group of order $11$ is $\mathbb{Z}_{11}$.

</aside>

## Theorem 5

The order of any element of a finite group divides the order of the group.

$$
(G: H) = \frac{\text{order of } G}{\text{order of }H}
$$

<aside>
üí° If $G$ is a group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, the **index** of $H$ in $G$ is the number of cosets of $H$ in $G$. We denote it by $(G: H)$.

</aside>

## Cauchy's Theorem

If $G$ is a finite group, and $p$ is a prime divisor of $|G|$, then $G$ has an element of order $p$.
